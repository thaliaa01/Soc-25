# Soc-25: On-Chain Crowdfunding
Week 1: Set up Python-based environment using Web3 and EthereumTester. Compiled and deployed a HelloWorld contract. Successfully called and updated greeting using Python.
Week 2: Created a Crowdfunding contract in Python with campaign struct, goal, and deadline. Used a mapping to store multiple campaigns.

Week 3: Implemented contribution logic using `msg.value`. Users can send ETH to support campaigns. Tracked `fundsRaised` and individual contributions.

Week 4: Implemented `withdrawFunds()` and `refund()` using `require`, `block.timestamp`, and custom error handling. Tested logic using multiple test accounts.
